  <div id="inner_left_works"><p>Years ago many may have not imagined harnessing one of the key sources of life for our energy benefits. The sunâ€™s rays possess unlimited potential energy that can power entire cities, even countries!<br><br>When sunlight hits a photovoltaic cell, the protons in the light knock the neutrons off the silicon plates inside the solar cell. These free neutrons are magnetically drawn through small wires connecting the cells together, creating an electric current. The direct current (DC) generated passes through an inverter that changes it to usable, alternating current (AC) which is used to power most household equipment. The AC power is back fed into the electrical panel and distributed throughout the house as needed. When the power created is not being consumed in the house, it passes through a series of meters and back into the grid.<br><br>If you generate more than you consume, this is called net metering. Net metering is a way of creating passive income as the power sold back to the grid receives market value for kilowatt-hours produced.</p></div>
