We believe that buyers attracted to the vision should still be able to make individual, practical choices based on income, desired price, design priorities and level of commitment to sustainability.</li><li>Quality design—the appreciation of and passion for architectural quality that stands out above the average home design. This includes the intelligent and attractive use of space and light, choice of materials and finishes, extra details regarding storage and access—all based on an understanding of the lives of the kinds of people who will occupy the home.</li><li>Community—a desire to be a part of something larger than oneself, including an awareness of the impact of individual choices on other people and the planet, and a desire to identify with others who share this awareness.</li></ul>"}

The base slab, foundations, walls and roof are encapsulated in a system of rigid insulation, sprayed foam, waterproofing membrane and a heat-repellent aluminum blanket. Together with double-paned windows, these high-tech features create a climate-resistant interior environment, while they help to reduce the costs of heating and air conditioning.<br /><br />In addition, G-8 homes are designed with front and back recessed facades, which allow winter sun to penetrate the building but also protect the interior from the high summer sun."},
				{ imgID : "aboutm3", org: "images/interior.png",over:"images/interior.png",z:"images/interior.png",title:"images/interior-t.png",con:"Inside the G-8 home, heating and cooling are provided by a ductless split-unit system, which operates only when and where it is needed in designated zones. This cuts down on the needless consumption of energy common in traditional systems.<br /><br />The central floor-through pier layout, and fully operable skylights, enable air to flow naturally throughout the entire building. Likewise, ceiling fans significantly increase the circulation of air, shortening the time needed for heating or cooling the space.<br /><br />The combination of well-placed skylights and cut-through floor openings allow daylight to penetrate the building and prolong the daylight, creating a more natural environment and reducing the need for artificial lighting.<br /><br />The sealed and insulated envelop of the building, together with the use of photo-voltaic panels and a vacuum-tube solar water heater, will reduce the cost of hot water to close to zero.<br /><br />The rain-water collecting system supplies a G-8 home with cost-free water for most needs by channeling rain to a reservoir from which it is circulated throughout the home, significantly reducing the use of water utility sources.<br /><br />Also standard in G-8 design are dual-flush toilets and low-flow shower heads and faucets, which further conserve on household water use."},
	    		{ imgID : "aboutm4", org: "images/finish.png",over:"images/exterior.png",z:"images/finish.png",title:"images/finishmat-t.png",con:"<strong>Finish Materials from Responsible Resources</strong> <br />Wherever possible, G-8 homes make use of recycled or renewable materials that have a low impact on the environment. This includes, for example, using flooring made of highly renewable bamboo and countertops and floors made of high quality cement. The paints used in a G-8 home are free of VOCs, volatile organic compounds, and are durable, cost effective and non-toxic.<br /><strong><br />Permeable paving system</strong>:<br />Permeable paving is a natural soil filtration system that allows storm water to recharge the aquifer and controls urban pollutants such as pesticides, fertilizer, de-icing salts, and dead leaves. Permeable paving prevents harmful soil erosion and diverts rainwater from the city's septic system.<br /><strong><br />Sprayed Polyurethane Foam</strong>:<br />As part of its on-going commitment to reduce energy costs and increase efficiency, G8 homes are built with sprayed polyurethane foam shells instead of conventional batt insulation. Sprayed foam shells are made from 40% recycled plasticizers and not only add structural integrity but are also twice as efficient as batt insulation. Sprayed foam helps seal G8 homes from all air and moisture penetration to make our homes more comfortable while drastically improving indoor air quality. <br /><br /><strong>Rain collection</strong>:<br />In addition to a standard permeable paving system, G8 backyards come equipped with a rain collection barrel. As rainwater falls, it is collected in the rain barrels for use in landscape irrigation, recreational activities, etc. In conjunction with the paving systems, every drop of rainwater that falls on a G8 site is kept out of the city storm water system. <br /><br /><strong>Solar PV</strong>:<br />The latest addition to the G8 gamut of alternative energy solutions is Solar Photovoltaic. Solar panels provide a clean, renewable on-site energy source that can be sized as either a supplement to a G8 home's energy consumption or to completely offset its carbon footprint. <br /><br /><strong>Solar Thermal Hot Water Heaters</strong>:<br />All G8 homes come standard with a solar thermal domestic hot water heating system, eliminating the need for expensive propane or natural gas water systems. To further reduce the home's water heating requirements, our systems come with an electric on-demand water heater that produces hot water only as needed, instead of constantly heating the tank as is done with conventional hot water systems."}
