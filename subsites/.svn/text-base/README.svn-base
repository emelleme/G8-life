SilverStripe 2.3.0 or higher

Documentation
-------------

Full documentation is available on [our wiki](http://doc.silverstripe.com/doku.php?id=modules:subsites).

To use subsites module with static publisher, see http://doc.silverstripe.org/staticpublisher#using_static_publisher_with_subsites_module

Known issues
------------

When setting up SubsiteDomains, the port is important.
If you are running on a non-standard port, you must put
that in the Domain text box.

Test coverage
-------------

Line coverage is over 70%, but function coverage is only 51%.

This is due to the difficulty of testing front end stuff like
model admin, left and main etc.
